      <h2 class="sectiontitle">Some Info And Introduction To FFXIV</h2>
      <p>
        Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, or Final Fantasy 14 if you will, is
        an MMORPG made by Square Enix (SE), and it originally came out it 2013
        for PC and PS3, and later on the PS4 and PS5.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has 5 Expansions, the latest being Endwalker, which has received
        Universal acclaim by critics.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a free trial for the game, where you can play from A realm
        Reborn (ARR) to Heavensward, and you can get up to level 60, which is a
        pretty good offer from SE, as originally it was up only to level 30 and
        only ARR.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content wise there is a lot of different things you can do, like
        dungeons, trials and raids for battle content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dungeons are 4 person instanced duties, where you go in and fight groups
        of enemies, and a couple of Bosses, which are powerful enemies
        in-between each section of the dungeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trials are also an instanced duty for 4-8 players, depending on the
        Trial. The objective in these duties is to defeat the Boss. Trials are
        usually unlocked through the main quest-line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raids is yet another type of instanced content for parties of 8 players,
        and is very similar to Trials where you have to defeat a Boss to
        progress, though unlike Trials they come in a series of 4 parts, and
        also usually has its own story which usually has very little to do with
        the main quest-line.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a lot of other content to discover so I highly recommend
        trying the game out, as it is very fun game.

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">My Own Experience With FFXIV</h2>
      <p>
        I've been playing ffxiv for over 8 years, and i have had a lot of fun,
        both playing solo and with friends. Its a great community to be a part
        of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a member of a Free Company, shortened to FC in most cases, and
        an FC is something similar to guilds in other games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a part of an FC has a lot of advantages, like buffs, stables for
        your Chocobo for example, not to mention the social aspect of course,
        like events and content runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FC I'm a part of is called Gilgamesh, shortened GIL, and it has a
        great community, with very helpful leaders and officers, annual events
        and great people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm very happy to be part of GIL, made some friends there and I wouldn't
        have as much fun in the without them.

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">The Harder Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        I have also done some of the harder content and, as of writing this, I'm
        in a static, for handling said harder content such as Savages and
        Extremes, but mainly Savages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extremes are harder versions of the Trials, with some different
        mechanics compared to the normal version, though you can do this content
        by looking
      </p>
      <p>
        Savages are a harder version of raids, with different and harder
        mechanics, and is best handled with a static.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also helps having a discord for communication purposes, like
        call-outs and for discussing mechanics, cause you won't have much time
        to type anything when the fight has started.
      </p>
      <p>
        some of the hardest content in the games is something called Ultimates,
        but this is something i haven't tried myself yet, i have just heard that
        its extremely hard to do.

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">In Closing</h2>
      <p>
        I'm really glad i started to play FFXIV, its been very fun and I have
        had a lot of joy playing it through the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story in it has been amazing and very emotional at times, and I have
        even cried a few times, mostly in the parts from Shadowbringer and
        Endwalker as it was both happy and sad moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will once again recommend trying the game out as it is a lot of fun.
